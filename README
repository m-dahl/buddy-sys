--- PREFACE  --------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

BuDDy was originally developed by Jorn Lind-Nielsen as a part of his
PhD thesis.
After using BuDDy as a BDD library for long time (while getting some
support from Jorn through email), I have been suggested by Jorn to take
ownership of the project and move it to SourceForge.
I invite all users who are interested to participate in the development
to contact me.  (I always have desired tasks / features awaiting...)

--- RUST SYS CRATE --------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This crate contains rust bindings based on the git repo at
https://git.code.sf.net/p/buddy/gitcode.

Since that repo has not been updated since 2014 I have taken the
liberty of copying the sources into vendor/, as I suspect the original
repo is more likely to dissapear than to receive additional bug-fixes.

List of fixes in vendor/ that are not in upstream:

* 6bef795 - Support fails to allocate new memory after a
  bdd_done/bdd_init cycle
